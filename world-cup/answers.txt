Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: at smaller numbers as the no of simulations increased 10 fold time did not increase significantly but after 10000 simulations the time increased drastically

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: the predictions were making sense after 100 so i would call it good enough after a 1000 simulations
